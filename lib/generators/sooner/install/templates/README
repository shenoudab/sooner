Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:
  1. Add mount to routes for Sooner to to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
  		mount Sooner::Engine => "/"

  2. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
